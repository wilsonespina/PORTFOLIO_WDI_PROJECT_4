## SUMMARY

My final project at General Assembly was to create a full MERN stack application with an open scope to create a RESTful site, achievable within a week. The site ended up being a social exercising platform which encourages people to compete and upload the best running traces theyâ€™ve saved on the social exercise app, [Strava](https://www.strava.com/). I combined map data received from the Strava API and with the Google Maps API to give a visual representation of run activities.
